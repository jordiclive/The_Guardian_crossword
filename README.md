# *The Guardian* crossword

App to redirect to the published crossword of the day by either *The Guardian* or *The Observer*

**Please note do not attempt to commercialise this app, deep linking is frowned upon and the Guardian has already launched and withdrawn a crossword app because they were unable to get enough people to pay for it.**

## Background

*The Guardian* publishes a quick crossword every day (nearly) bar Sunday.

*The Observer*, sister company, to *The Guardian* provides a speedy crossword on Sunday.

When run, this app automatically redirects to the Quick Crossword of the day unless it is a Sunday in which it redirects to the Speedy Crossword.

## How to run

For personal use on android, one can create an 'add-to-home-screen' from a codepen, or similar, url.
